"\nBeacon Anomalies",
"",
"A beacon anomaly may be defined as a beacon rate estimate that differs",
"sufficiently from the average beacon rate estimate that has been seen",
"in the past.  The rate estimates are based on the intervals beween",
"received beacons.",
"",
"Beacon anomalies come in groups.  When an IOC or other server comes",
"up, for example, it sends beacons that start with a short interval,",
"which increases monotonically until EPICS_CA_BEACON_PERIOD (default 15",
"s) is reached and then continues at that interval.  For a client which",
"has been receiving no beacons from the server, these are registered as",
"anomalies until the average rate becomes the same as the received",
"rate.  ParseCASW defines a group to have ended when no anomalies have",
"been received for 60 sec.",
"",
"ParseCASW puts these groups into categories as follows:",
"",
"Single anomaly: Only one anomaly in the group.  Could be owing to a",
"delay in the server or a delay caused by network traffic.",
"",
"Short sequence: 5 or fewer anomalies.",
"",
"Regular beacons, network coming back. The sequence is not short and",
"the difference between the maximum and minimum intervals is < 0.25.",
"Note that the server is sending out regular beacons in this case, but",
"the average beacon rate estimate is initially very slow because none",
"have been received recently.  It typically takes on the order of ten",
"beacons for the average rate to become the same as the received rate.",
"",
"Server coming up: A sequence that is monotonic and not short with the",
"ratio of the maximum interval to the minimum interval being > 25.",
"",
"Probably server coming up: Same as a server coming up except that 2",
"intervals are allowed to be non-increasing.  Owing to network delays",
"the short intervals, especially, may not be received at the same",
"intervals at which they were sent.",
"",
"Medium long sequence: None of the above and 15 or fewer anomalies.",
"This case may be caused by a server coming up or may not.",
"",
"Long sequence: None of the above and 50 or fewer anomalies.",
"",
"Very long sequence: More than 50 anomalies.",
"",
"Anomalies out of order: The time stamps of the anomalies are out of",
"order.  (Should not happen unless there is an error in the data.)",
"",
"Input",
"",
"If the input is from a file, ParseCASW will read the lines in the file",
"and produce a report.  If no file is specified, the input is",
"considered to come from stdin, typically having been piped from CASW.",
"If the input is from stdin, ParseCASW will check for finished groups",
"at the given interval and produce a report of the groups that have",
"finished.  If the input terminates, ParseCASW will produce a report of",
"the remaining groups.",
"",
"If stdin is a file and not a pipe from CASW, the lines will be read",
"until the end of file and a report produced, the same as if a file",
"were specified, provided the interval is long enough that no checking",
"occurs before the input is finished being read.  The -s option only",
"applies to the report at the end.",
"",
